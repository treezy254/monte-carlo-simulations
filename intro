Simulations
---
Experiments that attempt to imitate reality
Often use computer programs

Stochastic models simulate randomness in variables by using sampling. This randomness means that each simulation will likely arrive
at a different expected outcome, even when the inputs are the same.

Monte Carlo Simulations:
----
-Used to predict the probability of different outcomes by the presence of random variables
- rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results
- Results are stocastic since the model relies on random sampling


The Law of Large Numbers
---
As the number of identically distributed, randomly generated variables increases, their sample mean approaches their theoretical mean.

Resampling as a special type of Monte Carlo Simulation
---

Monte Carlo Simulation
--
- Sample from probability distributions
- Distributions eiter known or assumed
- Rely on historical data or expertise to choose proper distributions

Resampling
---
- Dample randomly from exiting data
- Existing data is implicit probability distribution
- Assume that data is representative

Resampling Methods
---
1. sampling without replacement
- used to draw random sam ple


2. Sampling with replacement(or bootstraping)
- Use to estimate the sampling distribution of almost any statistic

3. Permutation
- Often used to compare two groups


Leveraging Monte Carlo simulations
---
Monte carlo simulation are used in fileds such as...

Finance and business
	- Stock price prediction
	- Risk management
Engineering
	- Reliability analysis in engineering
Physical Science
	- Binding site identification


Benefits of Monte Carlo Simulation
---
-Take into consideration a range of values for various inputs
- Show not only what could happen, but how likely each outcome is
- Make it easy to visualize the range of possible outcome
- Can examine what would have happend under different circumstance


Limitations in Monte Carlo Simulations
---
- Model output is only as good as model input
- Probability of extreme events is often underestimated

NOTE: All models are wrong, some are useful
